1. There has two way to run it.
method1: order "make", and enter S, K, T, r, s, n, k step by step (just like announced on the course information website). It will calculate the answer automatically.
method2: execute “hw3”, and do it just like method1.

2. The source code is the file name "main3.c”, and the execution code is the file name "makefile”.

3. For the safety and speed of executing, the source code has set some default maximum number of n(number of periods) for 2000 and k(steps) for 1000000. If the number is bigger than it, please change the default number in line 7 ( for number of periods) and line 8( for steps) in the source code.
